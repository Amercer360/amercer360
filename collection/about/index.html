    <p class="abouttext">Antonio Gisbert PÃ©rez was a Spanish painter who was born in 1834 and died in 1901. My inspiration for this collection was the painting that appears at the top of the list, <em>Execution of Torrijos and His Companions on the Beaches of Malaga</em>. This painting has always fascinated me, so I took this opportunity to explore some of his other works. I am fascinated by the way in which he can capture clothing. Try paying attention to this as you look through the works.</p>
