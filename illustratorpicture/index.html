    <p>Because I missed class I've just created an image and instructions.</p>
    <p>It seemed unfair to ask people to do my program for me when they have already had to do the programs of other students, and I havent done any myself.</p>
    <p>Ill just hope the extra credit I earned on the early div projects carries me.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Create a blank canvas that is 600x600 pixels.</p></li>
      <li><p>Select the line tool and set the color to black.</p></li>
      <li><p>Create a line that bisects the canvas down the middle vertically.</p></li>
      <li><p>Create a line that bisects the canvas across the middle horizontally.</p></li>
      <li><p>Create a line that begins 100px from the bottom of the canvas and 100px from the right side. The line should run vertically up to 100px from the top of the canvas.</p></li>
      <li><p>Create a line that begins 100px from the right side of the canvas and 100px from the top. The line should run horizonatlly across to 100px from the left side.</p></li>
